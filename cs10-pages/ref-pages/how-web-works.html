<h2>How the Web Works</h2>
<hr>

<h3>What is a Web Page?</h3>
<p>A web page consists of a bunch of files that get displayed by a web browser.</p>
<p>A simple web page will usually include the following files:
</p>
<div class="combo-box">
  <div class="box1">
    <img src="images/webpage-files.PNG" width="300px">
  </div>
  <div class="box2">
    <h4>images folder...</h4>
    <p>...contains the image files to be used in the web page.</p>
    <h4>styles.css...</h4>
    <p>...contains the style rules that control things like color, fonts, layout, etc.</p>
    <h4>index.html...</h4>
    <p>...contains the content of a web page and is the document that the web browser will open. This document tells the browser
      how to put together the content, styles and images for the web page.</p>

<h3>Publishing a Web Page</h3>
<div class="combo-box">
  <div class="box1">
    <img src="images/world-wide-web.png" width="300px">
  </div>
  <div class="box2">
    <p>To make a web page visible to anyone with an Internet connection, you must upload the web page files to a server that
      is connected to the World Wide Web. Anyone can then use the Internet and the web page address to connect to the server
      and view the web page files in a web browser on their computer.</p>

    <p>It is recommended to develop and test web pages on a local computer before making them public. This local development
      will be the main focus of this course.</p>
